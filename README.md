# Goal
<p>The goal of this project is to minimize the necessary pieces required to play Settlers of Catan by digitizing the board and projecting it over a flat surface.</p>

# Motivation
<p>Settlers of Catan is a strategic board game that my family can't get enough of. Every holiday you can expect to find a Catan tournament taking place at the kitchen table during all hours of the day, tagging players in and out and breaking only for cooking and eating. However, with my in-laws being in the process of selling their home to live out their retirement on a catamaran, special measures have been taken to ensure we can still play our beloved game when in tighter quarters. In an effort to reduce the amount of physical pieces stored on the sailboat, I have designed this program to house the initial board setup, removing the need for ~100 physical pieces.</p>

# About the Game
<p>Settlers of Catan is a popular strategic board game that can be played traditionally, or with one or multiple expansion and extension packs. Expansion packs are an add-on that change the way the game is played by introducing new features and components. <i>Extension</i> packs contain additional pieces necessary to increase the max player count from 4 to 6, including player pieces and base tiles to create a larger board. Each expansion pack requires its own <i>extension</i> pack, as it contains additional pieces necessary to use these new features on the larger board. This program is compatible with Seafarers and Cities and Knights <i>expansion</i> packs as well as their respective <i>extension</i> packs. Because this program only handles hex, number token, and port logic of the initial setup, this is not a replacement for purchasing any elements from the game's original creators.

# About the Program
  <p>-Removes the need for physical versions of the resource tiles, number tokens, and ports as well as any game border pieces.</p>
  <p>-Uses constrained randomness to initialize the board pieces depending on the size and board type parameters and allows users 
    to reshuffle individual elements of the board or make manual modifications.</p>
